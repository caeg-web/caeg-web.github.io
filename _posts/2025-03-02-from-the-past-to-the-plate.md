## A Bold new era in sustainable agriculture

The **Ancient Environmental Genomics Initiative for Sustainability (AEGIS)** is a groundbreaking research initiative that seeks to revolutionize agriculture by leveraging **ancient environmental DNA (eDNA)**. In both scientific ambition and funding levels, the scale of AEGIS is **unprecedented**. Supported by the **Novo Nordisk Foundation** and **Wellcome Trust**, AEGIS aims to develop **climate-resilient crops** and sustainable agroecosystems by unlocking **genetic adaptations** of plants and microorganisms from the past. Led by **Professor Eske Willerslev**, the project integrates **paleogenomics**, **bioinformatics**, and **artificial intelligence** to decode historical responses of plants and ecosystems to climate change, thereby shaping the future of food security.

## Climate change and food Security

With **climate change** threatening global food production, agricultural sustainability is at risk. The [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/) predicts that by 2050, **10% of the world’s crop and livestock areas** will become unsuitable for agriculture, increasing to over **30% by 2100**. Current **monoculture-based cropping systems**, though optimized for today’s environment, lack **genetic diversity** and **resilience** to changing conditions. These systems rely heavily on **chemical fertilizers, pesticides,** and **irrigation**, which contribute to **soil degradation**, **biodiversity loss**, and increased vulnerability to **extreme weather conditions**.

### Why current agricultural solutions are falling short

Present efforts to combat agricultural challenges focus on **genetic modification** and **selective breeding**, based on contemporary genetic resources. However, this approach is constrained by:
- **Limited genetic diversity** due to centuries of selective breeding.
- **Short-term ecological studies**, which do not capture the full range of possible adaptations and biodiversity.
- **Uncertainty** in identifying key genetic traits for resilience in changing climates.

Nature has already conducted countless evolutionary **“experiments”** over millennia. By analyzing **ancient eDNA** from sedimentary archives, AEGIS can reconstruct historical ecosystems, identifying **lost genetic traits** and **species interactions** that enabled plants to withstand climatic shifts. A single gram of soil can reveal billions of DNA fragments from past organisms, offering an **unprecedented look** into past microbial, plant, and animal communities.

## Harnessing eDNA for agricultural innovation

AEGIS aims to retrieve and analyze ancient plant and ecosystem DNA to uncover **lost genetic adaptations** that can enhance crop resilience today. Key focus areas include:
1. **Exploring past changes** in ecosystems due to climate fluctuations.
2. **Studying the evolution** of key crops such as barley, wheat, and rice under different climatic conditions.
3. **Identifying adaptive native genetic traits** from ancient plants that can be reintroduced into modern crops.
4. **Developing innovative breeding strategies** based on nature’s own solutions to environmental stressors.

## Building a global research infrastructure

A global hub for **environmental genomics** is being established at the **University of Copenhagen**, featuring a **data engine** to process, analyze, and make eDNA data publicly accessible. The initiative is a collaboration between universities and research institutions across the world and will also include **plug-in projects** and **bioinformatic tool development** to ensure large-scale implementation of findings.

## Proof of concept: Bringing ancient crop traits back to life

AEGIS has already made significant breakthroughs. In an early experiment, researchers retrieved **2-million-year-old eDNA** from Arctic Kap København Formation sediments in Greenland. This analysis uncovered a unique ancient **blue-light receptor gene (CRY2)** in poplar trees, which could potentially enhance **light adaptation** and **stress tolerance** in crops. Using modern **gene-editing techniques**, researchers introduced this adaptation into barley, a crucial staple crop, to test its impact on growth and resilience.

## Impact and future vision: Transforming agriculture for a changing world

AEGIS represents a **paradigm shift** in agriculture. By integrating **historical biodiversity data** with modern **genomic tools**, AEGIS aims to enhance global **food security** while preserving **biodiversity**. The initiative aligns with the **Nagoya Protocol**, ensuring ethical and equitable use of genetic resources.

Through its innovative approach, AEGIS has the potential to transform food production, enabling the development of **self-sustaining, climate-resilient cropping systems**. By uncovering the **genetic blueprints of the past**, AEGIS offers a roadmap for sustainable agriculture in an era of **climate uncertainty**.
