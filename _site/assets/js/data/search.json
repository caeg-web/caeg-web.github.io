    "content": "Ancient environmental DNAThe great majority of the genetic information underpinning these adaptive responses has been lost through evolutionary change. However, a rich record of those responses survives in the earth over many thousands and millions of years as ancient environmental DNA (eDNA) (DOI: 10.1126/science.1084114). A single gram of sediment contains billions of DNA fragments and other ancient biomolecules, providing a comprehensive record of the organisms that inhabited the local environment, including fungi, bacteria, viruses, wild and domesticated plants and animals â€“ even in the complete absence of living organisms or fossil remains.  The past is the roadmap to a sustainable future"
